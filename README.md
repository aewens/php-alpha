My first real programming language was PHP. It's been awhile since I've used it 
and I've been trying to keep up with all the new toys out there like Node.js, 
ES2015, Angular, MongoDB, React, Rails, and all that other madness that keeps 
cropping up these days. I have decided to try and get back to my roots, though, 
and code in some PHP like the good ol' days. However, I'm a bit rusty with it, 
so this project will be me following along 
[howCode's](

again to make my own stuff.
